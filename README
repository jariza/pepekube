Shows weather data in a webpage using Kubernetes, ROS and a Netatmo Weatherstation.

Here you can find two folders...
- roscore, a docker image with a roscore (yup).
- kubernetes-configuration, all the required files for deploying the system in Kubernetes.

This system is currently working in http://pepekube.net

== WHY I DID THIS ==
I wanted to learn Kubernetes, and remember ROS (you know, feelings).
